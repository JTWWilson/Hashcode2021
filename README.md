# Hash Code2021

Our project for the Hash Code 2021 problem.

To run the solution, run *python3 datasets/a.txt solutions/a.txt 20* where the first file path is the input, the second file path is the output, and the final argument is the 'sensitivity'. Different sensitivities will work better for different input files.
